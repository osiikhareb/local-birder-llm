0,White-winged dove,whwdov,White-winged Dove,Zenaida Asiatica,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida,asiatica,"Bulky, grayish-brown dove with conspicuous white patch on wings. When perched, the white patch looks like a line along the bottom edge of the wing, but it is more obvious in flight, contrasting with the dark outer wings. Also look for bold white tips on tail feathers. Heftier and shorter-tailed than Mourning Dove. Also compare with Eurasian Collared-Dove; White-winged is darker and more contrasty on the wings and tail. Found in deserts, fields, cities and suburbs, and open wooded habitats from the southern U.S. to Panama (including the Caribbean). Usually common, sometimes traveling in large flocks, especially in winter. Visits backyard feeders."
1,Mourning dove,moudov,Mourning Dove,Zenaida Macroura,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida,macroura,"Svelte with a long, pointed tail. Plain brown overall with dark spots on wing. Juvenile is covered with pale scaly pattern, but is much larger and longer-tailed than ground doves. Widespread and common throughout much of North America, from southern Canada to Panama, including the Caribbean. Found in a variety of habitats from agricultural fields to lightly wooded areas. Loves suburbs, where it often sits on telephone wires and visits bird feeders. Avoids dense forest, but found on forest edges. Usually seen in pairs or small flocks, sometimes gathering in larger numbers, especially in winter. Listen for distinctive cooing song and whistling wings as it takes off."
2,Canada goose,cangoo,Canada Goose,Branta Canadensis,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta,canadensis,"A large brown goose with a black neck and white chinstrap. Overall size, bill size, and brown coloration variable across subspecies. Occurs in any open or wetland habitat, from city parks and golf courses to pristine marshes and Arctic tundra. Typically in flocks or family groups. Often seen in mixed flocks with Cackling Goose, especially in central and western North America. Canada Goose is almost always larger, longer-necked, and longer-billed than Cackling, although beware there is some overlap between the smallest Canada and largest Cackling. Abundant and widespread throughout the U.S. and Canada; rare in Mexico. Introduced and widely established in Europe. Listen for loud honking calls, especially as flocks migrate overhead in the classic V formation."
3,Blue-winged teal,buwtea,Blue-winged Teal,Spatula Discors,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula,discors,"Small duck with chalky-blue patches on the upperwing (visible in flight). Breeding males unmistakable with bold white crescent in front of eye and polka-dotted sides. Females are cold brown overall and intricately patterned. Look for a hint of a pale crescent on the face, as well as a dark eyeline and pale eye-arcs. Usually found in shallow wetlands or marshes, where it can occur in pairs or flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of ducks. Compare with other teal species: female Cinnamon Teal is warmer-toned overall and has a duller face pattern, while female Green-winged Teal is more compact, darker, and has a different wing pattern in flight."
4,Cinnamon teal,cintea,Cinnamon Teal,Spatula Cyanoptera,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula,cyanoptera,"Small duck with chalky-blue patches on the upperwing (visible in flight). Breeding males unmistakable with rich reddish-brown color overall. Females are buffy-brownish overall and intricately patterned. Look for rather plain face and longer, more spatulate-shaped bill than Blue-winged Teal. Widespread and fairly common throughout western North America and South America, as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Usually found in shallow wetlands or marshes, where it can occur in pairs or flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of ducks."
5,Northern shoveler,norsho,Northern Shoveler,Spatula Clypeata,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula,clypeata,"Medium-sized duck; smaller than a Mallard. Huge, spoon-shaped bill visible at a distance and in flight. Breeding males have dark green head, white breast, and chestnut sides and belly. Females buffy-brown with large, distinctive bill. Chalky-blue upperwing. Forages by sifting through the water, often swimming in spirals in groups."
6,Mallard,mallar3,Mallard,Anas Platyrhynchos,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas,platyrhynchos,"A large duck, generally common and familiar within its extensive range. Males are distinctive with iridescent green head, yellow bill, chestnut breast, and gray body. Females are mottled brown with orange and black splotches on the bill. Found anywhere with water, including city parks, backyard creeks, and various wetland habitats. Often in flocks, and frequently mixes with other duck species. In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap. Those species are all darker-bodied than Mallard. A good view of the wing can be helpful, too: white wingbars on the leading and trailing edges of the blue wing patch are bolder on Mallard. Frequently hybridizes with those species, which can be even more confusing. Any bird with extensive white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail has some Mallard genes."
7,Northern cardinal,norcar,Northern Cardinal,Cardinalis Cardinalis,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Cardinalis,cardinalis,"Striking and familiar backyard bird throughout most of eastern North America; also occurs in the southwestern U.S. and fairly extensively in Mexico. Crest, large red bill, and long tail render this species distinctive even with a poor view. Male is entirely red with a black face. Female is brownish overall with redder wings and tail. Usually seen in pairs or small groups near dense cover, especially thickets near forest edges. Frequently visits bird feeders. Listen for high-pitched metallic chips and series of loud, sweet whistles."
8,Pyrrhuloxia,pyrrhu,Pyrrhuloxia,Cardinalis Sinuatus,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Cardinalis,sinuatus,"Essentially a desert-dwelling cardinal, found in brushy areas of the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. Shaped much like a Northern Cardinal but with a longer, thinner crest and more rounded bill shape. Plumage is mostly gray with red highlights on the face, crest, belly, wings, and tail. Bill color is usually yellowish, but grayer on immatures. Usually seen in pairs or small flocks, often visiting bird feeders. Song is similar to Northern Cardinal but higher-pitched and more piercing."
9,Phainopepla,phaino,Phainopepla,Phainopepla Nitens,Passeriformes,Ptiliogonatidae,Phainopepla,nitens,"Unique bird of scrubby oak and mesquite habitats with a sleek body, shaggy crest, long tail, and staring red eyes.

11,Rock Wren,rocwre,Rock Wren,Salpinctes Obsoletus,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Salpinctes,obsoletus,"True to its name, prefers rocky areas, especially rocky slopes. Often perches conspicuously and bobs up and down. Pale grayish wren with whitish throat, buffy sides, and long, slightly decurved bill. Tiny speckles on back and wings like grains of sand. Undertail coverts barred black and white. Paler overall than Canyon Wren with a pale, buffy belly. Listen for its ringing vocalization. Sexes alike."
12,House Wren,houwre,House Wren,Troglodytes Aedon,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes,aedon,"At home in suburbs, parks, rural farmland, and other open areas with thick tangles. In the breeding season, it is often singing its effervescent song from the top of a bush or fence post. Plumage doesn't show much contrast: plain brown overall, slightly paler below, with some dark barring on the wings and tail. Lacks white eyebrow. In winter they are more secretive, preferring brushy tangles, thickets, and hedgerows."
13,Bewicks Wren,bewwre,Bewick's Wren,Thryomanes Bewickii,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Thryomanes,bewickii,"Long-tailed, rather slender wren. Dark brown above and pale grayish below with whitish eyebrow. Slender bill is slightly decurved. Favors dry scrubby areas, thickets in open country, and open woodlands near rivers and streams. Also at home in gardens, residential areas, and parks in cities and suburbs. Song is variable, but usually includes high-pitched buzzes and musical trills."
14,Northern Mockingbird,normoc,Northern Mockingbird,Mimus Polyglottos,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus,polyglottos,"Gray with whitish underparts and long tail. In flight, it becomes much flashier with large white patches on the black wings and tail. Pale eye. Found in a variety of habitats with bushes and trees, from neighborhoods to desert scrub and old pastures.

16,European starling,eursta,European Starling,Sturnus Vulgaris,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Sturnus,vulgaris,"Stocky and dark overall with short tail and triangular wings. A close look reveals beautiful plumage: in breeding season, look for purple and green iridescence and a yellow bill. In winter, shows extensive white and buffy spots over the entire body. Juveniles are plain grayish-brown; note bill shape. Native to Eurasia; introduced extensively across the globe. Often abundant, gathering in large flocks in open agricultural areas and towns and cities. Makes a variety of squeaky vocalizations, and often mimics other species. Visits feeders, where it is often aggressive towards other birds."
17,Black-tailed gnatcatcher,bktgna,Black-tailed Gnatcatcher,Polioptila Melanura,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila,melanura,"Tiny gray insectivore of scrubby areas in the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico. Breeding males show a black cap with a thin white eyering; nonbreeding males have a thin black line over the eye. Females lack any black on the head. Note tail pattern from below: mostly black with bold white spots. Prefers dry, scrubby habitats such as desert washes, where pairs flit around in the low bushes. Listen for harsh scolding calls. Compare with Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, but note Black-tailed often looks drabber brownish-gray, and has much more black on the underside of the tail."
18,Verdin,verdin,Verdin,Auriparus Flaviceps,Passeriformes,Remizidae,Auriparus,flaviceps,"Tiny, unique songbird with a sharply pointed bill. Mostly plain gray with a yellow head. Small rufous patch on shoulders is sometimes visible. Juveniles lack the yellow head; note bill shape to help separate from Lucy's Warbler or Bushtit. Forages solo or in pairs in scrubby arid habitats, especially mesquite. Occasionally visits hummingbird feeders for nectar; primarily feeds on insects."
19,Cassins Vireo,casvir,Cassin's Vireo,Vireo Cassinii,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo,cassinii,"Fairly dull vireo, intermediate between Blue-headed and Plumbeous. Grayish-olive overall, but with yellowish flanks and greenish back. Note white spectacles contrasting with gray head and two whitish wingbars. Breeds in mixed coniferous forests, especially in mountainous areas; winters in Mexico. Often separable from Blue-headed and Plumbeous Vireos by range, but can overlap during migration and winter. Cassin's is less contrasty than Blue-headed, especially between the gray face and whitish throat, and the greenish back blends into the nape and crown. Some birds are best left unidentified."
20,Bells Vireo,belvir,Bell's Vireo,Vireo Bellii,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo,bellii,"A fairly drab vireo of dense, scrubby vegetation, often near water. Two populations: Eastern birds are brighter, with yellow flanks and olive-green back. Note vague spectacled pattern around eye and one bright white wingbar (sometimes with a fainter upper wingbar). Western birds vary from dull olive above to entirely plain gray, usually with one bright wingbar. Look for long tail, often cocked and flipped around. Very active, flitting around nervously in low bushes and thickets. Listen for fast, scratchy song and harsh scold notes. Compare with the brighter and more contrasty White-eyed Vireo, especially in the East, and with the larger and plainer Gray Vireo in the West."
21,Ruby-crowned kinglet,ruckin,Ruby-crowned Kinglet,Corthylio Calendula,Passeriformes,Regulidae,Corthylio,calendula,"Tiny, hyperactive songbird with an uneven white eyering. Plain olive overall, with slightly brighter greenish edges on the wing and tail feathers. The namesake ruby crown is only present on males, and usually concealed. When agitated, it can be flared up into a bright expressive crest. Breeds in coniferous forests. In migration and winter, found in basically any wooded habitat, including deciduous forests, shrubby woodland, and field edges. Often forages quite low to the ground, sometimes joining mixed flocks of other songbirds. Energetic, moving quickly and flicking its wings. Listen for short, harsh call notes, usually doubled, and surprisingly loud song for such a small bird. Compare with Hutton’s Vireo, which is similar in plumage but has a thicker bill and forages more sluggishly."
22,Says Phoebe,saypho,Say's Phoebe,Sayornis Saya,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sayornis,saya,"Medium-sized flycatcher with distinctive salmon-orange wash on the belly. Otherwise grayish-brown with a contrasting black tail. Also watch for frequent tail-wagging. Widespread and fairly common in western North America. Breeds as far north as Alaska, and winters to southern Mexico. Always in open habitats, usually on a conspicuous low perch."
23,Black Phoebe,blkpho,Black Phoebe,Sayornis Nigricans,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sayornis,nigricans,"A medium-sized, sooty-black flycatcher. Marked geographic variation: most North American birds have dull wings and a clean white belly, while South American birds have bright white edging on wing feathers and much more limited white on the belly. Typically seen singly or in pairs, usually sitting conspicuously on a low perch. Frequently pumps tail up and down. Often near water; especially tied to fast-flowing, rocky streams in South America."
24,Olive-sided flycatcher,olsfly,Olive-sided Flycatcher,Contopus Cooperi,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus,cooperi,"Stocky flycatcher that almost always perches conspicuously on a high bare perch with an upright posture. From the front, look for dark sides creating a vest, with a bright white stripe from throat to belly. White patches on the sides of rump are sometimes visible from behind. Most similar to pewees but larger and larger-billed, with more contrasting vest. Feeds on insects. Breeds in clearings and bogs in boreal or mountainous forests, but can be found in migration in open habitats with a mixture of woods and clearings. Distinctive whistled song is often likened to ""quick, three beers;"" also listen for ""pip"" call notes."
25,Gray Flycatcher,gryfly,Gray Flycatcher,Empidonax Wrightii,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax,wrightii,"Drab, pale-gray flycatcher with little plumage contrast; very similar to other flycatchers, especially Dusky and Hammond's. Often best identified by unique habit of wagging tail downward. Breeding habitat also distinctive: lower, more open habitat than other flycatchers, usually in sagebrush or open juniper forest. In migration and winter, habitat overlaps more with other flycatchers, but still tends to prefer more open areas. Other subtle differences in appearance include shorter wingtips, longer bill, and paler plumage. Song includes hoarse ""chivik"" phrase and higher, clearer ""pseeoo."" Call similar to Dusky. Without an excellent view, sometimes best left unidentified."
26,Cassins kingbird,caskin,Cassin's Kingbird,Tyrannus Vociferans,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus,vociferans,"Fairly large yellow-bellied flycatcher of the southwest U.S. and western Mexico. Dark gray head contrasts with white mustache. Also note blackish tail with white tip (but this can be difficult to see, especially when worn). Found in open, arid habitats with tall shrubs and trees, sometimes venturing up into clearings and meadows in mountains. Most similar to Western Kingbird, which is paler and less contrasting on the head. Listen for burry “ch-breer” calls."
27,Western kingbird,weskin,Western Kingbird,Tyrannus Verticalis,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus,verticalis,"Fairly large yellow-bellied flycatcher; common and widespread in western North America. Rather pale gray head with weakly contrasting whitish throat and breast, and lemon-yellow belly. Also look for black tail with white edges (but this can be difficult to see, especially when worn). Found in open habitats with tall shrubs and trees, often perched up conspicuously on a telephone wire or fence post. Compare especially with Cassin’s Kingbird, which is darker and more contrasting on the head. Winters in large numbers south to Costa Rica, often gathering in large loose groups during migration."
28,Great tailed grackle,grtgra,Great-tailed Grackle,Quiscalus Mexicanus,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Quiscalus,mexicanus,"Large, lanky blackbird with flat crown and long tail. Males have ridiculously long tails, almost as long as their body, often held in a V-shape. Males are glossy black. Females are brown with paler eyebrow and throat. Eyes yellow to white; dusky for immatures. In coastal Texas, where its range overlaps with Boat-tailed Grackle, note habitat (more generalized as opposed to strictly saltmarsh) and pale eye (not brown)."
29,Gila woodpecker,gilwoo,Gila Woodpecker,Melanerpes Uropygialis,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes,uropygialis,"This desert-dwelling woodpecker is plain buffy-brown with black-and-white barring on the back. Adult males have a red crown. No similar species in range. Occurs singly or in pairs, often perched conspicuously atop a cactus. Comfortable in human settlements; frequently visits feeders and backyards in suburban areas. Primarily a Mexican species, occurring extensively across Baja and in the Pacific lowlands south to Jalisco. Limited range in the U.S., mainly in Arizona."
30,Gilded flicker,gilfli,Gilded Flicker,Colaptes Chrysoides,Piciformes,Picidae,Colaptes,chrysoides,"Large woodpecker, very similar to Northern Flicker. Overall pale sandy brown with gray face and brown crown. Spotted below with black oval on chest. Underwing and shafts of flight feathers bright yellow. Males have red mustache stripe; sexes otherwise alike. Combination of face pattern and yellow in wings helps distinguish from both ""Red-shafted"" and ""Yellow-shafted"" Northern Flickers. Shows a strong affinity for saguaro cactus but also found in nearby woodland. Gives a piercing ""kleer"" call similar to Northern Flicker."
31,Northern flicker,norfli,Northern Flicker,Colaptes Auratus,Piciformes,Picidae,Colaptes,auratus,"Large, brownish woodpecker with black barring on the back and black spots on the belly. Easily recognized in flight by its bright white rump. Also note large black crescent-shaped mark on breast. Wings and tail flash yellow or red, depending on the subspecies. Generally ""Yellow-shafted"" is found in eastern and northern North America, and ""Red-shafted"" is found in western North America as far south as Oaxaca. Birds from Chiapas to Nicaragua are larger with entirely brown crown, sometimes considered a separate species. Typically singly or in pairs, but can gather in large loose groups during migration and winter. Often seen feeding on the ground in open areas, foraging for ants and worms. Vocal and conspicuous: listen for loud “kleer!” call and series of laughing notes."
32,Eurasian collared-dove,eucdov,Eurasian Collared-Dove,Streptopelia Decaocto,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Streptopelia,decaocto,"Large pale dove with a black crescent on the nape. Slightly smaller and paler than Rock Pigeon, with a proportionately longer, square-tipped tail. Favors farms and suburbs; avoids areas with extensive forests. Typically seen in pairs or small loose groups; forms larger flocks in winter. Widespread and common throughout much of Eurasia and northern Africa. Introduced to, and established in, much of North America, the Caribbean, and parts of Central America. Compare with African Collared-Dove, which may occur in small feral populations or as an escapee throughout Eurasian Collared-Dove’s range. Especially note tail pattern from below: mostly white, contrasting with the grayish undertail coverts, and with black extending down the outer edge of the tail feathers. Voice - a cooing “woop-WOOO!-woop” - is also helpful."
33,Rock Pigeon,rocpig,Rock Pigeon,Columba Livia,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba,livia,"Fairly large pigeon with wild and feral populations throughout the world. True wild birds nest on cliffs and in caves from western Europe to central Asia. Pale gray overall with two bold black wingbars and iridescent purple and green on neck. Feral varieties are common in cities and farmland, often in large flocks. Variable plumage: some identical to wild-type birds, but can be completely black, white, or orangey-brown and any combination in between."
34,Greater roadrunner,greroa,Greater Roadrunner,Geococcyx Californianus,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Geococcyx,californianus,"A huge, ground-dwelling cuckoo. Streaky brown overall with a very long tail and short, shaggy crest. Surprisingly iridescent in good light, with purple and green tones on wings and tail. Usually seen on the ground in dry desert habitats with patches of thick vegetation; sometimes perches on fences or rocks, especially when singing. Runs swiftly after large insects, lizards, and other prey. Unmistakable in most of range; overlaps locally with Lesser Roadrunner in west Mexico. Greater has more streaking on the throat and center of breast, instead of clear buffy on Lesser. Listen for very low-pitched cooing song."
35,Lesser nighthawk,lesnig,Lesser Nighthawk,Chordeiles Acutipennis,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles,acutipennis,"Long-winged nocturnal bird which catches insects in flight often around dawn and dusk. Found in shrubby open areas. Intricate brown, buffy, and gray patterning with white patches near wingtips. Very similar to Common Nighthawk, best distinguished by the position of white wing patch: closer to wingtip on Lesser, closer to base of wing on Common, but this difference can be very difficult to judge. Also typically paler than Common with more golden buffy tones. During the day, roosts on the ground or on a tree branch."
36,Annas hummingbird,annhum,Anna's Hummingbird,Calypte Anna,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Calypte,anna,"Relatively large-headed and chunky. Gray and green overall, lacking buffy or orangey tones. Males have shocking magenta head, which appears dark when not catching the light. Females have dingy grayish underparts and often show a dark patch in the center of the throat. Note relatively short, straight bill compared with Black-chinned or Costa’s Hummingbird. Common year-round in the Pacific states of the U.S., mainly in relatively open or scrubby habitats including desert scrub and chaparral. Frequently seen in suburban yards and gardens, often visiting sugar water feeders. Expanding its range northward into British Columbia, even regular in southeast Alaska. Winters to southern Baja and locally elsewhere in Mexico. Listen for male’s scratchy, metallic song, given when perched."
37,Black-chinned hummingbird,bkchum,Black-chinned Hummingbird,Archilochus Alexandri,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Archilochus,alexandri,"Small hummingbird found in a variety of woodland and brushy habitats. Male distinctive with purple-and-black throat. Female has whitish underparts with almost no buffy tones (perhaps a very light wash on flanks). Tends to pump its tail more than other hummingbirds. Readily comes to sugar water feeders and flower gardens. Common in summer over much of the western U.S., barely into Canada. Winter range extends just south of Mexico City, and increasingly regular on the Gulf Coast of the U.S. Very difficult to distinguish from Ruby-throated Hummingbird, especially females and young males; thankfully limited range overlap. Black-chinned averages somewhat dingier green above, longer-billed with a slight droop, and has slightly broader, more club-shaped outer wing feathers, but these differences are all extremely subtle."
38,Black-necked stilt,bknsti,Black-necked Stilt,Himantopus Mexicanus,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Himantopus,mexicanus,"Elegant shorebird with exceptionally long, bright pink legs. Distinctive black-and-white plumage and thin black bill. Male is glossier black above, female is slightly browner. Some variation across range: darker neck in Hawaii; whiter crown and more extensive white collar in southern South America. Widespread and fairly common throughout the Americas, although rare or absent from much of the eastern U.S. Usually seen in pairs or small flocks, foraging in shallow ponds or marshes."
39,American avocet,ameavo,American Avocet,Recurvirostra Americana,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Recurvirostra,americana,"Distinctive large shorebird with a long, thin, upturned bill. Look for bold black-and-white wings and long blue-gray legs. Breeding adults have buffy-orange wash on head and neck; grayish in winter. Females have more sharply upturned bills than males. Widespread and fairly common in North America, although rare or absent from much of the eastern U.S. Usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering into the hundreds, foraging in shallow wetlands or estuaries. Feeds by swinging its head back-and-forth through the water to catch small invertebrates."
40,Killdeer,killde,Killdeer,Charadrius Vociferus,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius,vociferus,"Common, large plover. Slender shape with long wings and tail. Look for two black breast bands, unique among plovers in its range. Often nests near human development: parking lots, school roofs, road edges, and farms, usually on bare gravel. Adults perform broken-wing displays to distract predators from their nests and young. Gathers in larger numbers in migration and winter, often in fields with short grass or barren dirt. Occurs throughout North America; more local along the Pacific coast of northern South America. Can be very vocal; listen for loud namesake “kill-deer” call."
41,Lesser yellowlegs,lesyel,Lesser Yellowlegs,Tringa Flavipes,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa,flavipes,"Medium-sized shorebird with bright yellow legs. Plumage is essentially identical to Greater Yellowlegs: gray upperparts with white speckling, streaky neck, and white belly. Proportions are most important for identification. Lesser is smaller overall with shorter, narrower, straighter bill, shorter neck, more rounded head, and smaller chest. Forages actively on mudflats and in shallow pools and marshes, often in loose mixed flocks with Greater Yellowlegs. Somewhat more likely to be found in smaller, marshier habitats than Greater, but much overlap. Listen for soft, whistled “tew” calls, typically only one or two notes, unlike the stronger series of notes from Greater."
42,Neotropic Cormorant,neocor,Neotropic Cormorant,Nannopterum Brasilianum,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Nannopterum,brasilianum,"Black body. Immatures have dark brown breast. Orange facial skin comes to a point and is bordered by thin white line. Smaller, longer-tailed and shorter-legged than Double-crested Cormorant. Dives underwater to capture fish.

43,American white pelican,amwpel,American White Pelican,Pelecanus Erythrorhynchos,Pelecaniformes,Pelecanidae,Pelecanus,erythrorhynchos,"Extremely large and conspicuous. White with black wingtips. Very long, orange bill with pouch for scooping up fish. Forages in flocks, swimming together to concentrate fish. Often soars in flocks, infrequently flapping, during migration and when traveling between feeding sites."
44,Least bittern,leabit,Least Bittern,Ixobrychus Exilis,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ixobrychus,exilis,"This diminutive heron is fairly common in its preferred wetland habitat, but secretive and easily overlooked. Tiny size and attractive pattern of orange, black, and white is distinctive among herons within its range. Males are blacker above; females are browner. Occurs throughout much of North and South America, where it can be found in marshes with a mix of open water and vegetation, often with cattails, phragmites, or lily pads. Usually seen perched motionlessly, straddling reeds at the edge of water. Occasionally makes short flights just above the reeds. Listen for the soft cooing song, given during the day and at night."
45,Great blue heron,grbher3,Great Blue Heron,Ardea Herodias,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea,herodias,"Huge gray heron, no other similar species in range. Note large yellow-orange bill, short black plumes on head, and black and chestnut pattern on shoulder. Immatures are more brownish than adults, and have a dark crown. Fairly common and widespread throughout North America; wintering range extends to northern South America. Occurs in almost any wetland habitat, from small ponds to marshes to saltwater bays. Usually seen singly but can gather in numbers where food is plentiful. White form, sometimes considered a separate species (“Great White Heron”), is found in southern Florida and the Caribbean. It is most similar to Great Egret but has a larger bill."
46,Great egret,greegr,Great Egret,Ardea Alba,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea,alba,"Large, lanky, long-necked white heron. Size and black legs help separate from other egrets. Widespread and fairly common across the globe. Bill color varies across range: always yellow in the Americas, black in breeding season elsewhere. Occurs in any shallow wetland, including ponds, marshes, and tidal mudflats. Slowly stalks prey in shallow water. Often seen singly, but sometimes gathers in large numbers where food is plentiful. Breeds in colonies, frequently mixed with other egrets and herons."
47,Snowy egret,snoegr,Snowy Egret,Egretta Thula,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta,thula,"Small white heron with black bill, black legs, and yellow feet. Lores (between eye and bill) are usually bright yellow, but flush reddish in the breeding season. Also note lacy plumes on head, breast, and back during breeding season. Immatures have duller yellow lores and more yellow extending up the legs than adults. Fairly common and widespread in North and South America; often most common along the coast. Found in a variety of wetland habitats, especially shallow marshy pools and mudflats. Forages fairly actively in shallow water, often darting after small fish. Compare with immature Little Blue Heron, which usually has more greenish legs and lores, and note Snowy’s more active feeding style."

In flight, looks slightly less angular than other swallows, with more rounded wings. Note pale buffy-orange rump, which separates Cliff from most other swallows in range. Also look for dark throat and pale forehead. Widespread and fairly common, especially in western North America. Breeds under bridges, overpasses, and culverts. Winters in South America. Compare especially with Cave Swallow, which has a paler throat and orange forehead."
103,White-faced Ibis,whfibi,White-faced Ibis,Plegadis Chihi,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Plegadis,chihi,Long decurved bill. Dark overall with iridescent green and reddish tones on adults. Broad white border to reddish face and red eyes. Found mainly in shallow wetlands of the western U.S. Best distinguished from Glossy Ibis by range and facial pattern. Also note more subtle features: reddish legs and paler bronzy tones to wings.
104,American Coot,y00475,American Coot,Fulica Americana,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Fulica,americana,"Plump, chicken-like bird that acts like a duck. Gray overall with blacker head and white bill. Tiny tail and short wings. Feet are large, yellow-green, and oddly lobed. Head jerks back and forth when swimming. Forages for aquatic vegetation anywhere with water: ponds, city parks, marshes, reservoirs, lakes, ditches, and saltmarshes."
105,Common Gallinule,comgal1,Common Gallinule,Gallinula Galeata,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallinula,galeata,"Blackish, chicken-like marsh bird, often found near cattails, never far from water. Often seen swimming, picking at the water's surface, or walking along the edge of aquatic vegetation. Thick legs and long toes are drab yellow. Adults have bright red bill with yellow tip, thin white side stripe, and some white under the tail. Immatures are paler and grayer than adults, lacking brightly colored bill."
106,Pied-billed Grebe,pibgre,Pied-billed Grebe,Podilymbus Podiceps,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podilymbus,podiceps,"Small brown grebe with a stout bill. Note dark eyes. During breeding season, look for black ring around white bill. In winter, neck is often washed with a cinnamon tone. Juvenile has stripes on head. Fairly common and widespread throughout the Americas, where it occurs on ponds and marshes, often with emergent vegetation. Frequently dives underwater to feed on fish."
107,Lesser Scaup,lessca,Lesser Scaup,Aythya Affinis,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya,affinis,"Peak-headed diving duck. Males have black breast, finely-barred gray back, whitish sides (often slightly dusty-looking), and yellow eye. Head appears black with a purplish or greenish sheen in good light. Females are brown overall with white patch at base of bill and yellow eye. Very similar to Greater Scaup; note Lesser’s peaked head shape with angle near the rear of crown, slimmer cheeks, less extensive white stripe on wing in flight, and smaller, narrower bill. Also similar to Ring-necked Duck, but Lesser Scaup has grayer back and whiter sides. Usually in flocks or pairs on a variety of wetland habitats, from small ponds to large lakes and bays. Slightly more likely to be seen on smaller bodies of water, especially fresh water, than Greater Scaup, but much overlap. Frequently in mixed flocks with other Aythya ducks. Widespread across North America, with more southerly range extent than Greater Scaup, regularly reaching northern South America."
108,Ring-necked Duck,rinduc,Ring-necked Duck,Aythya Collaris,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya,collaris,"A relatively small diving duck with a tall peaked crown. Males are handsome with glossy black head and back, clean gray sides, and a brighter white spur on the side. Females are grayish-brown, often with a paler patch at the base of the bill and a white eyering. Both sexes have a white band near the tip of gray bill. Also note gray, not white, wingstripe in flight. Usually favors small bodies of water, such as beaver ponds and cattail marshes, but also occurs on larger lakes, rivers, and bays. Can be found in mixed flocks with other diving ducks, although usually in smaller numbers than scaup. Compare with both species of scaup and Redhead (especially females)."
109,American Wigeon,amewig,American Wigeon,Mareca Americana,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mareca,americana,"Breeding males have obvious white blaze on forehead and broad green slash behind eye. Females are plainer brown with rusty sides. Females are very difficult to distinguish from female Eurasian Wigeon; note colder grayish-brown head on American that contrasts with warmer orangey sides. Also look for brighter white, not gray, underwings in flight, but this can be difficult to judge, especially at a distance. Widespread and common in North America, occasionally wintering as far south as northern South America. Typically in flocks on lakes and wetlands, often grazing in nearby fields. Regular vagrant to Europe."
110,Belted Kingfisher,belkin1,Belted Kingfisher,Megaceryle Alcyon,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Megaceryle,alcyon,"Stocky and large-headed with a shaggy crest. Bill is long, straight, thick, and pointed. Powder blue above with white underparts and blue breast band. Females have additional rusty band across belly. Almost always solitary, perched along edges of streams, lakes, and estuaries. Flies along rivers and shorelines giving loud rattling calls. Hunts for fish by plunging headfirst into the water, either directly from a perch or hovering."
